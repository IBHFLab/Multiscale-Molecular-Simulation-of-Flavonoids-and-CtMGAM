# Multiscale-Molecular-Simulation-of-Flavonoids-and-CtMGAM
Project Overview
This repository contains the computational data and analysis scripts used in our study to investigate the binding and dissociation mechanisms of flavonoid inhibitors against maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM). By integrating advanced computational methods such as microsecond-scale molecular dynamics (MD), Markov state models (MSMs), steered MD (SMD), umbrella sampling, and quantum mechanical calculations with biophysical spectroscopy, we elucidate the atomistic mechanisms of three flavonoids—myricetin, genistein, and chrysin—against the C-terminal domain of MGAM (CtMGAM).
Key resources available in this repository:
	Coordinates of Representative States: Key structural snapshots from the simulations.
	MSM Definitions & MD Input Files: Files for reproducibility of MSM analysis, including topologies and simulation parameters.
	PMF Windows & WHAM Outputs: Data used for potential of mean force (PMF) calculations.
	IFP/IGM Scripts: Scripts for analyzing interaction fingerprints (IFP) and independent gradient model (IGM), with tutorials for use.
By making these resources publicly available, we aim to enhance the reproducibility and transparency of our work, facilitating further research and collaboration in the field of MGAM inhibition and drug design. For detailed instructions on using the provided files, please refer to the documentation included in the repository.
